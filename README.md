## Credits

This project was inspired by
[Analyzing Samsung Health Data](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kmader/analyzing-samsung-health-data/notebook#Samsung-Data) notebook by K. Scott Mader.

Concepts and methodologies for parsing, cleaning, and visualizing Samsung Health exports have been adapted to align with the latest update of the Samsung Health app, version 6.30.5.105, released on September 23, 2025.

Thanks to K. Scott Mader for the practical examples and clear methodology.
